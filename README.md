# POSIX PortableFilename
 
 Simple tool to be called from cmdline, to make all filenames compliant with POSIX portable filename character set (ISO 9945, XBD, clause 3.282). In default mode, though, it only strip accents.

# Explorer context menu subcommands

 This tool creates dynamic submenu in Windows Explorer context menu, with user defined commands. Dynamic means that you can define e.g. "open in notepad" command only for files with less than 1 MB len.
